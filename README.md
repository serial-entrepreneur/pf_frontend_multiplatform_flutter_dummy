# Flutter Multiplatform Dummy Project

> **Learning Purpose**: This repository is specifically designed for learning purposes. It serves as a practice environment where developers can learn Git workflows, branching strategies, code review processes, and Flutter development through hands-on experience. The project is intentionally structured to provide a safe space for making mistakes and learning from mentor feedback.

This repository serves as a practice ground for learning Git workflow, branching strategies, and code review processes. The project is designed to help developers understand the complete development lifecycle through hands-on experience.

## Project Structure
- This is a Flutter multiplatform project where you can practice implementing features and following best practices
- Each developer will work on their own development branch
- Code reviews will be conducted by mentors to provide feedback and guidance

## Development Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine
3. Create your development branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your_name_dev
   ```
   Example: `john_doe_dev`

### 2. Feature Development
1. From your development branch, create a new feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive messages
3. Push your feature branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### 3. Pull Request Process
1. Create a Pull Request (PR) from your feature branch to your development branch
2. In the PR description:
   - Clearly describe the changes made
   - Mention any specific areas you'd like mentors to review
   - Tag relevant mentors using `@mentor-name` for review
3. Wait for mentor feedback

### 4. Addressing Feedback
1. When mentors provide feedback:
   - Make the necessary changes in your feature branch
   - Commit and push the changes
   - Tag the mentors again using `@mentor-name` to notify them of the updates
2. Once approved, your PR can be merged into your development branch

## Best Practices
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep your branches up to date with the main repository
- Respond promptly to mentor feedback
- Follow Flutter best practices and coding standards
- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting PRs

## Getting Help
- If you have questions, create an issue in the repository
- Tag mentors using `@mentor-name` when you need specific guidance
- Use the project's discussion board for general questions

## Note
This is a learning project, so don't hesitate to make mistakes and learn from the feedback provided by mentors. The goal is to improve your development workflow and code quality through practice and guidance.
